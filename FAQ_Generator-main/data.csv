The MS program is excellent preparation for a career as a computer professional, or for future entry into a PhD program at Stanford or elsewhere. Individual programs can be structured to consist entirely of coursework or to involve some research. Students more interested in research, may pursue a ""MS degree with distinction in research"". See the ""Research or Project Requirement"" section of theStanford Bulletinfor more information. Entering the MS program is by no means a guaranteed path to a PhD at Stanford. Admission into the PhD program for current MS students is far from assured. However, students admitted into the MS program may gain experience to demonstrate academic potential at Stanford, and perhaps to align with a faculty member in research. To be eligible for admission in a Stanford graduate program, applicants must meet: Any questions about the admissions eligibility should be directed toadmissions@cs.stanford.edu. Completed Online Application must be submitted by the CS application deadline. The online application can be foundhere. For all graduate admission applications, the deadline is final and submissions will not be accepted after the deadline has passed.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Electrical Engineers design systems that sense, process, and transmit energy and information. We leverage computational, theoretical, and experimental tools to develop groundbreaking sensors and energy transducers, new physical substrates for computation, and the systems that address the shared challenges facing humanity. Computer science deals with the theory and practice of algorithms, from idealized mathematical procedures to the computer systems deployed by major tech companies to answer billions of user requests per day. Artificial Intelligence and Decision-making combines intellectual traditions from across computer science and electrical engineering to develop techniques for the analysis and synthesis of systems that interact with an external world via perception, communication, and action; while also learning, making decisions and adapting to a changing environment. Dear prospective applicant, Thank you for your interest in graduate study in EECS. For information on EECS, please visit our web page:http://www-eecs.mit.edu/. The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department does NOT require GRE scores for admission purposes. Admission is determined by GPA (Grade Point Average) although there is not an official cut-off, letters of recommendation (we need three of them) and a “Statement of Objectives” in which you write an essay detailing your research interests. For more information about writing a Statement of Objectives, seethis article from the MIT EECS Communication Lab. A very strong background in math, physics, engineering, or computer science is a necessity. Admission for the limited number of openings is extremely competitive and each year we are forced to turn down hundreds of applicants with excellent credentials. Since we do not have a terminal Master’s program in EECS, everyone must apply for PhD. Applicants who gain admission pursue the Master’s degree on the way to the PhD. If a student already has a Master’s from another school, there is no need to do another Master’s degree here at MIT. We use an online application system which you can access by going tohttp://web.mit.eduand link to admission. The online system becomes available around the middle of September. Decisions on financial aid are made after admission decisions are reached. International students are eligible for research assistantships which pay a monthly stipend and full tuition. Research supervisors are determined after admission decisions are reached or shortly after registering in EECS in the Fall. Admitted students are also eligible for certain fellowships. International students must take the TOEFL exam and earn at least a score of 100 (internet-based). In some cases, the TOEFL can be waived; such as if you’ve been in U.S. for at least two years, or if your country’s first language is English. International students can also take the IELTS exam if the TOEFL is not available to you. We need to see a score of ‘7’ on this test. It also can be waived for the same reasons as the TOEFL. We do NOT offer spring term admission. The deadline for applying for Fall Term 2022 is December 15, 2021. The online application will be available between September 15, 2021 and December 15, 2021.

Full-time Commitment:~2 years Focus:Leads to career in industrial R&D or Ph.D. The MS only degree is intended mostly for currently registered UC Berkeley Ph.D. students that want to add the degree. Occasionally we admit exceptional applicants with research experience, but the cohort generally is limited to less than 10. Students interested in a research oriented degree should consider applying directly to the MS/PhD program. If you are planning to immediately join the engineering profession without pursuing a Ph.D., theMaster of Engineering(M.Eng.) is specifically designed as a professional master’s degree. Full-time Commitment:5-6 years (starting with a Bachelor’s),  3-5 years(starting with a Master’s) Focus:Research + teaching experience A Ph.D. in EECS combines coursework and original research with exceptional faculty mentoring to  prepare students for a career in academia or industry. The EECS Department offers two types of Ph.D. degrees (EE and CS). The principal requirements for the Ph.D. are: *The Master of Science (M.S.) Only program is a very small research program for exceptional applicants with research experience.  Applicants should consider applying to the MS/PhD program, since there are very few students in the M.S. only program. The student-run Equal Access Assistance (EAAA) program aims to ensure that all applicants to higher degree programs (M.S./Ph.D.) at Berkeley EECS have access to guidance on the higher degree application process. One current (or recent graduate) in EECS will provide feedback on your statement of purpose, personal history statement, CV/resume, and other application materials in advance of higher-degree application deadlines in the fall semester.  This feedback will be Berkeley- and admissions-focused, as opposed to grammar or formatting advice. Application for admission to Berkeley EECS is a process that must be completed separately; participation in EAAA does not guarantee admission nor affect the admissions decision-making process in any way.

Georgia Institute of Technology,"Admission to the program is highly selective; there are many more qualified applicants than there are places in the program. The challenge for the College every year is to select a class from a highly qualified pool. The College looks for compelling reasons to admit candidates, and the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores and GPA are all reviewed carefully. Having a strong undergraduate background in computer science, including C programming, is highly recommended for applicants. The Admissions Committee welcomes additional pertinent information that will aid in making objective and informed decisions. Students are admitted to the master's program only once a year. The application deadline is Feb. 1 for admission to the following fall semester. A student who is enrolled in another graduate program of the Institute may pursue an MSCS while that student is also pursuing his or her degree in the other major. To be granted permission to pursue the MSCS, a student must submit to the Office of Graduate Programs in the College of Computing the material required for admission to the MSCS program. This includes transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the GRE General Test. If the student is approved by the admissions committee to pursue the MSCS, the student will be notified in writing. At no time will a student outside the College be allowed to pursue a concurrent degree without prior permission of the admissions committee.

Columbia University,"The basic requirement for admission as a graduate student is the bachelor's degree received from an institution of acceptable standing. Ordinarily, the applicant will have majored in the field in which graduate study is intended, but in certain programs preparation in a related field of engineering or science is acceptable. The applicant will be admitted only if the undergraduate record shows promise of productive and effective graduate work. The Master of Science (MS) degree is required for admission into the PhD and EngScD degree programs. A student who holds an appropriate bachelor's degree in engineering may apply for admission to either the MS only or MS leading to PhD program. A student who has not already earned an MS degree and is looking to pursue a doctoral degree should apply for admission to the MS/PhD track program, with the exception of the Computer Science PhD program. All doctoral applicants to the Computer Science Department should apply for admission to the PhD program, regardless of whether they have completed an MS degree or not. Students enrolled in the MS/PhD program are considered doctoral students, and are eligible to receive equivalent funding. More information about the doctoral degree can be found inthe bulletin. Consideration for admission will be based not only on the completion of earlier courses of study, but also upon the quality of the record presented and upon such evidence as can be obtained concerning the candidate's personal fitness to pursue professional work. The following materials must accompany theonline applicationfor on-campus graduate programs: If you have questions about any of the application requirements, pleasevisit our FAQ.

What are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share? USC has given me everything–challenges that helped me learn from my experiences,opportunitiesthat helped me grow professionally and personally and above all aplatformto showcase my talents. I started off by acquiring a good GPA, went on tobecome aCourse Producer for one of the most popular courses of the CS departmentCSCI 571: Web Technologies, and secured a Summer internship as a software engineerIntern at Walmart. Being away from home for the first time in my life, USC made meresponsible andtaught me the value of time, people and money. I have learned to staystrong, independent, motivated, and not to take success to head or failure to heart !! Which organizations/activities have you been involved with outside of the classroom? Apart fromacademic excellence,USC hassomeamazing student chapters/organizations, whichgive students an opportunity to expand their network and build their managerialskills. I have been a part of the Hindu Student Organization (HSO) in my first semester,where I was a part of the logistics team. I had to arrange, organize and manage events.This gave me outstanding experiences, from which I learned to be more spontaneous inlife.Additionally, I was a part of the USC Bookstore, where I was a student worker. Thisgave me countless memories, as everyday I got to meet people from different culturesall over the world, and helped me expand my network. I also got to meet a lot ofcelebrities during this time.. Tell us about an exciting and unforgettable experience from your time so far at USC.I did my Bachelor’s degree at the American University in Bulgaria–a small universitywhere anyone quickly gets to know everyone. USC on the other hand is a huge universityfor the standards of where I come from. It has the same population as my entirehometown. I didn’t know anyone, and I didn’t know much about the area of theuniversity. I had to be proactive to go around and learn about my surroundings and meetpeople. Kind of like a quest to explore the unknown land. Ithad its challenges, especiallywith COVID measures being enforced. But it was so much fun and exciting. I still look backat my first few weeks with a smile on my face. I went to all of the new student welcomingevents and met so many bright and inspiringpeople who have a wide variety of interestsand skills. I highly encourage new students to do something similar. Meeting people andparticipating in events and activities is how unforgettable memories are made and howopportunities open up. What aresome personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?I think I managed to meet people from all the continents now, and from so manycountries. I think learning about other cultures is such an eye-opening experience inmany aspects. You start to understand other people more, but you also learn more aboutyourself. I especially encourage internationals and people like me who come fromsmaller towns to explore cultural events. After all, you don’t get such chances every day.Check out an on-campus event, go to a concert, or a sports game, travel around LosAngeles. You might be surprised how much you will grow from that as a person. Which organizations/activities have you been involved with outside of theclassroom?I am part of the Fulbright community in LA, the USC Star Wars club, and Remedy ThroughMusic which is a volunteering club for musicians. I have also applied to be a mentor inFall 2022.. What are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?I'm joining the camera sensor industry this summer as an Intern!

With legal lane splitting in California, It is a paradise for riders. What advice would you give future Viterbi students?Look at the curriculum first and see if the school offers courses to your interest before you make a decision. Don't buy a car if you live near the campus. You will not drive it often. Begin preparing for job interviews as early as possible.. What are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?Getting an internship in one of the best companies in the world -Microsoft along with three other best offers, shocked me of my own abilities. Which organizations/activities have you been involved with outside of the classroom?I hold the position of Senator for the Viterbi Graduate Student Association for two semesters and participated in USC Thorton musical school’s choir - Oriana.

	You will be required to pay an application fee. 
	While completing this application, please note the following.Text boxes will be provided for you to fill out two statements, an academic statement and a personal statement.Do not enter your full statements in the text boxes in the MSU graduate application. 
Instead, type in these text boxes that ``Full statement will be uploaded using the graduate student portal.''However, please do answer the supplemental questions at the end of the application even though your statements may include responses to these questions. 
Responses to these questions are used by the admissions committee to help identify strong applicants to nominate for university and college fellowships.
Answering these questions will increase the chances that your application is considered for these fellowships.Save your MSU applicant ID and password as you will need this to complete the second step of the application process.Upload/enter additional application materials/information using thegraduate student education portalwhich you access with your MSU applicant ID and password.Enter information for references who will then be asked to submit letters of recommendation.You need 3 references.Ideally, at least two references should be college faculty who know you well.You can complete this step prior to submitting your MSU graduate application. You are strongly encouraged to do so to give your references more time to complete their letters.Upload your full academic and personal statements.
Please follow the guidelines below when completing your statements.Academic StatementPersonal StatementTranscripts and Degree CertificatesUnofficial transcript for reviewFor review purposes only, you must upload an unofficial transcript of all college work (undergraduate and graduate) in the graduate student portal.For this uploaded unofficial transcript, do NOT upload a secure transcript.This complicates review of your application as our program will not be able to automatically concatenate all the uploaded files into a convenient PDF.
Just upload an unofficial transcript in regular PDF format with no security features.Please ensure that you include the back side of one transcript page (this back side often includes critical rating/scale information); no need for more than one back side page.Official transcript(s) and degree certificate(s) for admissionWe also will need official transcripts for admission. The documents needed depend on the following scenarios:You will have received a Bachelor's degree (or Masters degree) prior to April 15 for Fall applications or August 15 for Spring applications.In this case, you must arrange for delivery of official transcripts and proof that you have received your degree before you can be admitted to our graduate programs. This proof might be your official transcript if it includes language that your degree has been conferred. For international students especially, this proof often is in the form of a certificate. You must submit both an English language certificate plus an original language certificate. These documents must be sent directly from your institution to MSU.You will NOT have received a Bachelor's degree prior to April 15 for Fall applications or August 15 for Spring applications.In this case, you must arrange for delivery of official transcript(s) directly from the institution(s) to MSU.All official documents must be sent directly from each university in a sealed envelope. 
These documents should be sent to the following address:Office of AdmissionsMichigan State UniversityHannah Administration Building426 Auditorium Road, Room 250East Lansing, MI 48824U.S.A.If you are applying for admission in fall semester and will graduate in December, please submit the unofficial transcript online as early as possible but wait to submit your official transcript and certificate until it reflects that you have graduated as MSU will require these documents before processing your admission and giving you an I-20 if you are an international applicant.For applicants with degrees from Chinese universities, please follow the above process. In particular, during the application process, MSU does NOT require CDGDC verification of transcripts.If you are admitted to the computer science MS or PhD program, MSU will eventually require CDGDC verification of your final bachelor degree transcript and bachelor degree. 
Note that CDGDC verification of MS degrees or transcripts is never required.CSE will REIMBURSE you for the cost of CDGDC verification once you 
arrive and are officially an MSU student. We will work with you to make this verification process as easy as possible. The application for admission, application fee, and all the required
supporting documents should be received at least two months prior to

California Institute of Technology,"Applicants must have completed a bachelor's degree or the equivalent before beginning graduate study. Applicants who already hold a Ph.D. degree will not be considered for a second Ph.D. degree. Transcripts from each college or university attended, three letters of recommendation, a CV, and the applicant's statement of purpose are required components of the application and are carefully and equally weighed during the evaluation process. GRE tests (general and advanced subject) are not required and in most options scores will not be considered for admission. Most of the funding sources require work authorization. As a consequence, matriculation into the PhD program requires evidence of work authorization, unless special compensation can be arranged with the admitting option. Applicants are expected to read, write and speak English and comprehend the spoken language. Although not required for admission, for applicants whose native language is not English or who have not received a degree from a university or college where English is the primary language of instruction, it is important to demonstrate a strong capability in English. This can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational Testing Service (TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the Cambridge Examinations and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or other services that provide a certified English-language proficiency examination.",What is graduate school like at Caltech and how does the admission process work? | Where can I find the application deadlines? | Does Caltech have rolling admissions? | When can I expect to receive an admission decision? | Will I be interviewed or have a chance to visit Caltech? | Is there a separate application for financial aid? | What type of financial support is available? | Do I need to take the GRE exam? | What is the minimum GPA? | Are international students required to report a GPA?
Pennsylvania State University,"Master of Science (M.S.) Integrated B.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Computer Science View The program is professionally oriented and designed to prepare students for employment in industry or government. Courses emphasize practical concerns as well as the relevant theoretical background. The program will provide appropriate background for diverse tasks such as: While not intended as preparation for subsequent entrance to a Ph.D. program, this goal is not precluded. Once the specific course requirements are met, appropriate selection of electives will enable individual interests to be met within the program. Applicants apply for admission to the program via theGraduate School application for admission. Requirements listed here are in addition to Graduate Council policies listed underGCAC-300 Admissions Policies. Applicants must present a baccalaureate degree in Computer Science or a related field from a regionally accredited institution. A minimum GPA of 2.75 (on a 4.0 scale) is required. While a bachelor's degree in Computer Science is not required, admission without deficiency requires that an applicant has completed courses in analysis of algorithms, operating systems, database, and linear algebra. If these courses are not taken before admission to the program, they may be taken at Penn State Harrisburg, but the student will receive at most 3 credits toward the M.S. degree for these courses. At the discretion of the program, applicants may be required to provide scores from the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and/or the GRE subject test in computer science. In addition, applicants must provide three letters of reference, at least one of which is from an academic source, and a letter outlining significant work experience and academic and career objectives. Requirements listed here are in addition to Graduate Council policies listed underGCAC-600 Research Degree Policies. A total of 30 credits (400-, 500-, 600-, or 800-level) is required for the Master of Science in Computer Science. Students are required to take the following courses: Additionally, students are required to complete either a thesis or a paper according to one of the two options described below. Students who believe that they have completed a course substantially similar to one of the specific course requirements may apply to have their previous work evaluated for the purpose of exemption to that requirement. If the exemption is granted, another approved course shall be taken in place of that required course. The remaining 18 credits must be completed according to one of the following options: Research into a specific computer science problem, development of a scholarly written paper, and an oral defense. This option requires: In-depth study of specific computer science problems, development of a written paper or project, and an oral defense. This option requires: A maximum of 9 transfer credits will be allowed for course work completed as a graduate student at another institution, subject to restrictions outlined inGCAC-309 Transfer Credit. For students with interests in the areas of software engineering, systems programming, and artificial intelligence, the program suggests the following course work. These tracks are only advisory--there is no requirement that a student follow any track, and tracks will not be noted on diplomas or transcripts. Students following the track in software engineering will be provided with the conceptual tools needed for designing and managing large software systems. In addition to the required core, the track in software engineering consists of the following courses: In addition to these courses,CMPSC 470is highly recommended, as compiler development is an ideal environment for gaining practical experience with software engineering techniques and tools. Students following the track in systems programming will receive instruction in both the conceptual foundation of systems software and the implementation of such systems. In addition to the required core, the track in systems programming consists of the following courses: Students following the track in artificial intelligence are expected to gain an understanding in the theory and applications of AI methods as well as evolutionary methods for solving a variety of problems. In addition to the required core, the track in artificial intelligence consists of the following courses: This Integrated Undergraduate/Graduate (IUG) degree program combines the B.S in Computer Sciencewith theM.S. in Computer Scienceofferedat the following campuses: UndergraduateDegree Abington Harrisburg GraduateDegree Harrisburg Thegraduateportionof this IUG is currently offered asface-to-faceresidential instruction.While the undergraduatecurriculum for this IUG maybe completed at multiple campuses, the ease and feasibility of completing the integrated programmay be heavily dependent upon the location of the graduate instruction.Please discuss the feasibility of completing the IUG with a representative for thegraduate programbefore beginning the application process. Requirements listed here are in addition to requirements listed inGCAC-210 Integrated Undergraduate-Graduate (IUG) Degree Programs. The Computer Science program offers a limited number of academically superior Bachelor of Science candidates the opportunity to enroll in an integrated, continuous program of study leading to both the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and the Master of Science in Computer Science. The ability to coordinate as well as concurrently pursue the two degree programs enables the student to earn the two degrees in five years. Students in the IUG program must satisfy the degree requirements for both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. However, the total course load is reduced due to the maximum of 12 credits that can count towards both degrees. The first two years of the IUG program are identical to the first two years of the Bachelor of Science program. The third and fourth years of the IUG program differ from those of the Bachelor of Science program due to the courses that count toward the Master of Science degree requirements. Student performance will be monitored on an on-going basis. In addition, a formal evaluation of student academic performance will be performed when the student has completed 100 to 105 credits, which is at the end of the first semester of the senior year for a typical student in the program. Students who have not maintained a 3.5 GPA in their Math and Computer Science courses will be put on probationary status with respect to the IUG program. Their ability to continue in the IUG program will be based on their academic performance in the last semester of their senior year. As part of the review in the senior year, students will be advised about the paper option and thesis option in the graduate program. Students intending to pursue the thesis option would be advised to do so only if they have been doing very well in the program and are in no danger of not being able to continue into the fifth year. A minimum grade point average of 3.5 must be earned in all math and computer science course work that is applied toward the graduate degree. This includes any courses that count toward both the undergraduate and graduate degrees, as well as all courses taken during the fifth year. Students who successfully complete the courses listed in the recommended schedule will satisfy the requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree by the end of their fourth year. Applicants apply for admission to the program via theGraduate School application for admission. Requirements listed here are in addition to Graduate Council policies listed underGCAC-300 Admissions Policies. To initiate the application process, students must submit an Integrated Undergraduate-Graduate (IUG) Degree in Computer Science Application Form, a transcript, and a faculty recommendation, in addition toapplying for admission to the Graduate School. Students must apply to the program via theGraduate School application for admission, and must meet all the admission requirements of the Graduate School and the Computer Science graduate program for the Master of Science degree, listed on the Admission Requirements tab. Before applying to the Graduate School, students must have completed entrance to their undergraduate major and have completed no less than 60 credits. Students must be admitted no later than the end of the second week of the semester preceding the semester of expected conferral of the undergraduate degree. Transfer students must have completed at least 15 credits at Penn State to enroll in an IUG. In consultation with an adviser, students must prepare a plan of study appropriate to this integrated program, and must present their plan of study to the head of the graduate program or the appropriate committee overseeing the integrated program prior to being admitted to the program. The plan should cover the entire time period of the integrated program, and it should be reviewed periodically with an adviser as the student advances through the program. For consideration for acceptance into the program, students must have completed and earned a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in the following Computer Science and Mathematics courses: Student applications will be evaluated based on their overall academic performance, in addition to the above requirements. In all cases, admission to the program will be at the discretion of the Graduate Admissions Committee in Computer Science. Students must fulfill all degree requirements for each degree in order to be awarded that degree, subject to the double-counting of credits as outlined below. Degree requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science are listed in theUndergraduate Bulletin. Degree requirements for the Master of Science in Computer Science are listed on the Degree Requirements tab. Students must sequence their courses so all undergraduate degree requirements are fulfilled before taking courses to count solely towards the graduate degree. Students are expected to complete the undergraduate degree requirements within the typical time to degree for the undergraduate major. In the semester in which the undergraduate degree requirements will be completed, IUG students must apply to graduate, and the undergraduate degree should be conferred at the next appropriate Commencement. If students accepted into the IUG program are unable to complete the M.S. degree, they are still eligible to receive their undergraduate degree if all the undergraduate degree requirements have been satisfied. Up to 12 credits may be double-counted towards the degree requirements for both the graduate and undergraduate degrees; a minimum of 50% of the double-counted courses must be at the 500 or 800 level. Independent study courses and credits associated with the culminating experience for the graduate degree cannot be double-counted. A graduate minor is available in any approved graduate major or dual-title program. The default requirements for a graduate minor are stated in Graduate Council policies listed underGCAC-600 Research Degree PoliciesandGCAC-700 Professional Degree Policies, depending on the type of degree the student is pursuing: Graduate assistantships available to students in this program and other forms of student aid are described in theTuition & Fundingsection of The Graduate School’s website. Students on graduate assistantships must adhere to thecourse load limitsset by The Graduate School. Graduate courses carry numbers from 500 to 699 and 800 to 899. Advanced undergraduate courses numbered between 400 and 499 may be used to meet some graduate degree requirements when taken by graduate students. Courses below the 400 level may not. A graduate student may register for or audit these courses in order to make up deficiencies or to fill in gaps in previous education but not to meet requirements for an advanced degree.

For the MEng track, we require a background equivalent to two semesters of introductory programming courses (that is, to have successfully completed a ""CS2"" course at an accredited institution). We do sometimes admit students with a background that does not meet this expectation. Such students are typically required to take additional courses to make this up. Our primary admissions criterion to the MS and Ph.D. programs is our expectation regarding your ability to have a productive career as aresearch-track graduate student. We base this assessment on the academic record, proficiency in English speaking and writing, letters of recommendation, research experiences such as independent study projects, and prior internship/work experience. All of these are imperfect indicators of the real trait that we are interested in assessing, namely ability to succeed inresearch. If you have direct evidence, such as research publications in competitive conferences, or if your letter writers can speak to these abilities, that is considered more valuable than any score cutoffs. For this reason, we do not declare official minimum scores and cutoffs since performance on these measures is just one factor considered. For the MS/PhD tracks, we require a background equivalent to two years of undergraduate training in computer science, including at least: In addition, we expect a background in mathematics to include courses in linear algebra, discrete mathematics, statistics, and at least one year of calculus. We do sometimes admit students with a background that does not meet these expectations. Such students are typically required to take additional courses to make this up. We accept students into our program for both Fall and Spring semesters, though the large majority of our applications are for Fall. Fall 2022 saw a large increase in applications to all of our programs. Here is a rough breakdown by campus and degree for total applications and applications admitted. Seeherefor information on application deadlines.All applications must be submitted online formally through the Virginia TechGraduate School's online application form. The entire package comprises: This varies slightly each year. Fall semester typically begins in the third or fourth week of August. Spring semester typically begins in the third or fourth week of January. You should be on campus and ready to attend orientation by the Monday one week prior to the start of classes. The MEng track is coursework only. This in turn leads to different expectations in terms of minimum background, the skillset training emphasis, and the typical time to completion. The MEng track is better suited for students who seek to enter the computing profession at the graduate level. It supplies strong technical training, but with less emphasis on ""soft skills"" gained from the thesis experience. Students taking the MEng can often complete the degree more quickly.  The MEng track requires completion of a traditional second semester programming course. The MS track requires completing a thesis. MS track students are expected to have the equivalent of a CS minor (typically two years of coursework). Students taking the MS track should expect to spend four academic semesters in the program. MS track students will gain greater experience with a number of ""soft skills"" associated with completing a thesis, including a significant writing experience, more experience with self-directed research work, and often more communications and group project skills. It is a natural stepping stone to the PhD. Our GTAs are drawn from the MS and Ph.D. students. Transfers from another Virginia Tech department into computer science are evaluated just like a regular application to the Department of Computer Science. First, complete and submit a change of graduate program request form (available from theGraduate School forms page). This will enable us to request your application file (transcripts, recommendation letters, and essentially all components of the original application) to be sent over from the graduate school to the Department of Computer Science for evaluation. Transfer students seeking to enter the MS or Ph.D. track should already have selected and have the support of a research advisor from CS before we evaluate the transfer request. This is not a requirement for students seeking to enter the MEng track. If you seek to enter the MEng track, simply submit a completedApplication for Simultaneous Degree form. We only admit research-track students (MS/Ph.D.) after a CS faculty member has agreed to serve as the thesis or dissertation advisor. This is normally only done when the student already has a standing research relationship with the potential advisor stemming from the research program being done in the home department. To request consideration for a Simultaneous Degree for the MS or Ph.D. tracks, do the following: Yes, you are required to upload one copy  of your scanned official transcript from each institution where you have earned or will earn a degree.  Please do not mail paper copies of your official transcripts (or anything else!) to us.  For more information visit theGraduate School. You can submit all the remaining materials by the deadline and submit the scores through the application portal once they arrive. We will continue to review applications as they become complete - so aim to schedule these exams as early as possible. You can track your application's progress online once it has been submitted. The Graduate School will send you an e-mail with instructions for checking your application status. The Department of Computer Science is not able to respond to emails or phone calls regarding the status of applications. We do not do pre-reviews of applications. We will evaluate your application material once you officially  apply via the Graduate School. The only sure-fire way to know if you will be admitted is to apply. The Graduate School has minimum requirements for an application to be considered. We follow those published minimums. Perhaps the most important is the requirement that students from non-native English speaking countries have a minimum combined score of 90 on the internet TOEFL exam or 6.5 overall on the IELTS. All students must have the equivalent of a 3.0 minimum GPA. Our primary admissions criterion for the MEng program is our expectation regarding your ability to successfully complete the program. We base our assessment on the academic record (amount of computer science background, where previous degrees were obtained, class rank and grade point average, and scores on standard exams such as the GRE general exam and TOEFL), proficiency in English speaking and writing, letters of recommendation, and prior internship/work experience. Our primary admissions criterion for the MS and Ph.D. tracks is our expectation regarding your ability to have a productive career as aresearch-track graduate student. All of these are imperfect indicators of the real trait that we are interested in assessing, namely ability to succeed in your chosen program. If you have direct evidence of research ability through research publications in competitive conferences or journals (for the MS/Ph.D. tracks), or if your letter writers can speak to your abilities, that is considered more valuable than any score cutoffs. For this reason, we do not declare official minimum scores and cutoffs, etc. since performance on these measures is just one factor considered. We no longer consider GRE scores for admission to our graduate program. Request letters from people who can provide a detailed assessment of your capability to engage in graduate studies/research, i.e., those who have had ample opportunity to observe you in studies/work. Since we are a research-oriented graduate program, we look for evidence of research ability in these letters. Ideally, you should request letters from your most recent academic program and perhaps one letter from your most recent work experience (if applicable to your research skills). Ideally, the letters should be no more than two years old. We will not categorically disregard older letters, but recent letters and letters from people who can directly attest to your research abilities will be given greater consideration. The primary form of support available to incoming students in the MS/Ph.D. programs include Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTAs) and fellowships. Sometimes, students might be offered Graduate Research Assistantships (GRAs) by individual professors, but these decisions are made by the specific faculty members. When making decisions on offers of GTAs, we do not take financial need or ability of students to support themselves into account. However, international students who are not given a GTA will not be offered admission unless they have completed a financial certification form indicating sufficient resources available to complete their degree requirements. Moreinformation on funding opportunities. Research-track applicants may apply to either the MS or Ph.D. programs. Qualified students wishing admission to the Ph.D. program, without first completing an MS, are welcome to do so. Note however that the Ph.D. program has some requirements that differentiate it from the MS program, including a Ph.D. qualification process. For more information, see thedegree requirements. The place to start is with contacting faculty, and arranging to work with them. Here are some places to get information on who might be good to ask. Your first question is likely to be: Who is working in an area that I am interested in? TheResearch Areaspage should be a good starting place for this, but be aware that many of our faculty work in multiple areas, or on topics that are hard to pigeonhole in this way. Your next question might be: Is this person actually taking new students? There is huge variation on this point between faculty members, since some might be overloaded with students, actively growing their group, or unavailable for research activities at the moment. You can seethis spreadsheetwhere we track the current status of faculty members with respect to how actively they are recruiting new students. Be aware that the typical faculty member gets a lot of emails from prospective students. Some students succeed in getting an advisor before they start the program, and some students get ignored. While the outcome depends in part on what you have to offer as a graduate student, a lot is also a matter of how you go about approaching potential advisors. In particular, an initial contact email needs to clearly explain what you are asking for, and most importantly it needs to explain why you are contacting that particular faculty member. This means that you need to do your homework, and be able to tell the person you are contacting why their research in particular is of interest to you, and how your experience or interests make you a good candidate for their group. Anything that looks like a form letter is likely to be ignored. It is generally a bad idea to lead with needing support. If you do, the person you are contacting might think that you only care about the support, not them or the research area. If you are accepted into the group, then often support will come in time. For advice on how to succeed as a research-track graduate student, see thesepresentation slides. Depending upon the course, an online option may be available. Sections of the course that are online can be taught as synchronous (at a fixed time with the ability to interact live with the class and instructor) and asynchronous (prerecorded lectures and tutorials that can be viewed at the student's convenience).  Consult theUniversity Timetable of Classesfor information about specific course offerings. Whether you have decided to accept our admission offer or decline it, we ask that you tell us about your decision. You should see buttons to accept or decline at theapplication portal. You can also email your decision tograds@vt.edu. If you are accepting admission, then your next step should be to check out the Graduate School'sNew Student Checklist. The Graduate School will send you an official letter when they admit you. This includes information on the process for international students who need to get a visa and I-20. The decision letter sent from the Graduate School is the official notification (postal mailed to domestic mailing addresses; emailed to international mailing addresses). Applicants can also see the status in the Guest Account they are directed to create with the application submission confirmation email. GSAPP is not the place to track status. We ask that you consider submitting your decision to attend or not attend Virginia Tech as soon as possible. We recognize that applicants may have offers from multiple institutions and need to make an informed decision on where they will attend. However, it can take considerable time to complete the visa process. If you are applying to start in Fall semester, we recommend that you apply for your I-20 by April 1st (and no later than April 15). For Spring, we recommend that you apply for your I-20 by October 1st (and no later than October 15th). Please note that immigration and visa related services will be handled by different offices depending on the campus you attend.

University of California Davis,"Apply Today Our primary goal in selecting students for our graduate program is to find individuals who have demonstrated academic achievement, a solid academic background in computer science (completion of an undergraduate program comparable to the undergraduate program at UC Davis) and the potential to tackle the complex thinking and writing that graduate study requires. We evaluate this by looking at specific coursework in computer science. We also use your statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, resume/CV, and GPA (median undergraduate GPA of Fall 2022 admits is 3.736). Admission to theGraduate Group in Computer Scienceis highly competitive. On average, we receive over 2,000 applications for admission and generally admit the top 10%. The GGCS admissions committee is primarily looking for individuals who have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement in computer science. However, we know that a student with an undergraduate major in a related field (electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, etc.) may have the ability to do well in our program. In addition, in the past truly exceptional students with a background in a field not related to computer science have been admitted to our program. The latter students have demonstrated their academic potential through their undergraduate experience and letters of recommendation. The likelihood of admission to the program in any year depends on the applicant pool. In recent years, the applicant pool has become increasingly competitive. Very few students without a solid academic background in computer science are currently able to put forth a competitive application. At the very minimum, students without a degree in computer science must complete the courses listed in the admissions requirements for theM.S.andPh.D.degrees, though completion of this list of courses is rarely sufficient to gain admission.

University of Colorado Boulder,"Skip to Content Explore the sections below for the admissions requirements for the program you plan to pursue. Next Step: How to Apply The requirements in this section apply to applicants to the PhD in Computer Science, MS in Computer Science and the Professional MS in Computer Science. Applicants must hold at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent from an institution comparable to the University of Colorado. They should have programming experience, a number of computer science courses and sufficient mathematical maturity to understand pure mathematics courses at the upper division (junior/senior) level. The following prerequisites areREQUIREDfor admission both Traditional and Professional Master's degree in Computer Science. For PhD applicants, the Department of Computer Science welcomes PhD applications from interdisciplinary backgrounds. Modern computer science often combines important ideas from multiple fields, including physics, mathematics, economics, biology, psychology, and more. We welcome students from all such backgrounds, and do not require a prior degree in computer science. Applicants should identify a common research interest with faculty and communicate with students in their labs before application, seen on theCS research website. While we highly recommend that PhD applicants complete the listed prerequisite courses before submitting their application, for PhD admissions, the research match is the most important factor taken into considerations while making decisions. Therefore, please do go through research happening in our department to make sure this is the right place for you! Completing the prerequisites helps you in handling our graduate courses better and also opens more opportunities to be a Teaching Assistant.  We also highly encourage such students to identify areas and faculty members they wish to work with and/or get in touch with the faculty directly through email. Research area match is the most important factor in PhD admissions. Your academic background should include at least three semesters of mathematics at the level of sophistication of calculus or above. Examples of such courses such are calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, probability, statistics and abstract algebra. The courses should indicate that you have achieved the mathematical maturity expected of an upper-level science, engineering, or mathematics undergraduate. At least four one-semester courses in computer science that are beyond the introductory level are required for MS admissions and highly recommended for PhD admissions. These are intended to demonstrate your breadth of basic computer science knowledge in the areas of computer hardware, software and theory. The courses should include the equivalent of the followingUniversity of Colorado offerings: More advanced versions of all courses are acceptable. The courses in the Hardware, Software and Theory Requirements are prerequisites to many of the graduate-level offerings, so it’s important to complete these to be considered for graduate admissions. Admission without these prerequisites or their equivalents may be considered under extraordinary circumstances only. Courses completed through Coursera or any other online degree platform taken for non-credit do not fulfill the admissions prerequisites requirements. Courses completed through Coursera or any other online degree platform taken for-credit at the graduate level that appear on an institution’s official transcript with grades are considered as fulfilling admissions prerequisites requirements. Courses through Coursera or any other online degree platform taken for-credit at the undergraduate level that appear on an institution’s official transcript with grades are considered admissions prerequisites requirements. You must have a grade point average of at least 3.0 (on a scale of 4.0).  Applicants having the listed qualifications will, if accepted, be classified as regular degree students. However, admission to the graduate programs is competitive, and a grade point average at this level will not ensure admission. Competitive applications to PhD and CSEN-MS (research based MS) degree typically have a 3.5 or higher GPA and competitive applications to CSEN-MSCPS (course based MS) have a 3.3 or higher GPA. GRE scores are not required for admissions to CSEN graduate degrees at CU Boulder. Applicants for graduate study in network engineering must hold at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent from an institution comparable to the University of Colorado. We also recommend that candidates have experience in network engineering, system administration or network programming. GRE scores are not required for admissions to this program.

Northwestern University,"By bringing the power of computer science to fields such as journalism, education, robotics, and art, Northwestern University computer scientists are exponentially accelerating research and innovation. Watch our video above or learn more at the link below. To maintain a proper balance between department resources and the size of the graduate student population, the department must limit offers of admission to the most qualified applicants. Thus, the admission process is highly selective and competitive. Details on the process are outlined in the sections below and in theGraduate Application FAQ. Admissions FAQStart Your Application Jump to a Section Applications for the 2024-2025 academic year will become available on September 13, 2023 on theapplication website. The deadline for PhD applicants is Friday, December 1, 2023 (for Fall 2024).You can still apply after this deadline, up to December 15, 2023. However, be aware that applications are usually reviewed soon after the deadline, so late applications may not be processed as quickly. Most of the decisions are typically finalized by the end of March, but some decisions may be made as late as April 15. ThePhD Application Feedback Programaims to assist first-generation and underrepresented students with their applications to Computer Science PhD programs in the US. An advanced PhD student, postdoctoral fellow, or CS faculty volunteer will provide one round of feedback on an applicant's resume and statement of purpose (capacity limited). Volunteers may also arrange for a short 15 to 30-minute Zoom meeting to offer additional advice. Participation in the PhD Application Feedback Program does not guarantee admission to any program. To participate in this year's PhD Application Feedback Program, please submit your application materials by November 8, 11:59 p.m. CST.Apply now Applications are accepted for Fall quarter only. For the MS program, applications No applications afterFebruary 28will be considered. The absolute deadlines regarding certain admissions-related actions by TGSare available here. Return to Top There are no paper application forms for either admission or financial aid. To apply for admission to the CS department, go toThe Graduate School (TGS) website, follow the link to ""Admission,” and then finally ""Apply Online"" Return to Top TGS's online application form will ask you to select either the PhD or MS option for computer science. If you want a PhD, with or without a master's degree, select the PhD option. The MS option is for terminal master's only and does not constitute admission to further work toward a PhD. It will also ask you to enter research area(s) among theresearch interest groups. Once you complete the online application, you will receive an email message asking you to provide additional information about your GPA and specific research interests. You will be asked to select your two or three top choices among the six research interest groups, based on your specific research interests. You may give more detail in your Statement of Purpose. For example, a student who would like to pursue research in ""wireless networks"" might select the Systems and Networking group. Disregard any blank sections you may see in the HTML view of your application after submission. Those were not required for the degree program you were applying to. If you have submitted therequired application materials,do not worry about the “Materials needed” flag. This is on be default and only turned off after we manually review the application and its attachments and determine if the English Language requirement has been met or waived. This may take a week or more during the busiest times. You will be contacted if any critical materials are missing. Return to Top Before you apply online, gather the following: Please note that it is not required to send a hardcopy of your official transcripts. Instead, upload a scanned copy of it/them as PDFs, along with all the other supplementary materials, into your online application. Note that upon admission you may be required to provide the original transcript(s). An applicant may not be admitted without a complete application. All primary and supplemental materials must be submitted to render a decision to admit. Denies may be made due to incomplete applications. Return to Top A typical applicant is expected to have a bachelor of science in electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, or a related discipline from a recognized institution. Highly qualified candidates with other academic backgrounds may also be considered. The specific undergraduate preparation required for graduate study depends on the program and the area of specialization. An applicant who has insufficient undergraduate preparation in any particular area but is well-qualified in every other respect may be required to take certain undergraduate courses as soon as possible after enrolling at Northwestern. That student would be informed of such a requirement at the time of admission.​ Return to Top A current Northwestern University CS MS student can request a transfer from the MS program to the PhD program. Such a transfer request is only seriously considered if there is a CS faculty member who advocates the transfer and commits to financially supporting the student. That faculty member will help the student formally apply for the transfer, which will then be considered by the department. Students may formally apply for a transfer without a faculty advocate, but the chance of approval in this case is very low. Return to Top MS and PhD applicants should apply to begin only in the fall quarter. Note that we only allow for fall admits to both programs. Winter and spring quarter admission requests by MS and PhD applicants will be automatically denied, in general. The only mechanism for winter or spring quarter PhD admission involves the intervention of one of our faculty, who must agree to support the student in question as a research assistant for the remainder of the academic year. To explore this possibility, an applicant should contact individual professors listed in th department's faculty directory. You can view a great deal of general information about requirements and policies on The Graduate School website. For more info, please contact the CS department graduate office. Return to Top For both MS and PhD students, we require: Learn more about English language requirements Return to Top We understand that proceeding with the application process for graduate studies is not an easy decision or something that should be considered lightly. To help you in making up your mind and give you some hints regarding the overall evaluation criteria, we provide a discussion of some of the relevant issues below. We do receive applications with transcripts using different GPA scales (10.0, 100%, etc.) and we apply the adjusted criteria to such scales. Hence, applicants do not need to provide any conversions and should leave their GPAs in their institutions' standard scale. As another specific example, many of the universities from India have a ""class-based"" evaluation scheme, and we note that we will always give priority to ""First Class with Distinction"" applicants. The application process does allow you to write the ""self-reported"" GPA on the scale of 4.0; however, we will always use the transcripts during evaluation process. Master's and PhD applicants:GRE scores are neither required nor considered in applications. Please keep in mind however that you will still need to meet the minimum requirements for English proficiency as stated above. Primarily for PhD applicants, CS faculty interested in advising may conduct separate interviews for further informal assessment of applicants. Refer to requirements at Graduate School SeeThe Graduate School descriptionof what is expected for the required Academic Statement and Personal Statement. For PhD applicants, the Academic Statement carries extremely important weight, so the statement should be written in a clear and focused manner. Namely, upon reading it, an evaluator/faculty should get a crisp idea as to: Statements should provide a good balance between background, vision, and desiderata. Example: simply saying that you like Northwestern or you have a high esteem for the faculty in CS is not recommended. Lastly, while this may not always be possible, it will be helpful if at least some parts of the recommendation letters can back up the claims made in the statement of purpose. In the online application system, each applicant will be given the option to choose in order of preference among different Programs of Study in our department. Faculty examine applications in their respective areas; therefore, every applicant, especially for the PhD program, should carefully examine every faculty members research interests on our website. Furthermore, applicants will be asked to provide up to two names of specific faculty members whom they would like to study under. This is highly recommended and useful for identifying candidates to consider. A minimum of two letters is required, but three is highly recommended. We will value all your achievements (e.g. awards received in competitions) and experiences (e.g. research projects, leadership). However, the best place to put them in a coherent manner is your resume. Ideally, some of these items should also be properly linked with the statement of purpose document.

University of Virginia,"*All Master’s degrees require a minimum of 31 graded, graduate-level credits (a graduate-level class is any class numbered 5000 or above). A graded credit means that the course resulted in a letter grade (A, B, C…) as opposed to an audited course (AU) or a pass/fail or credit/no credit course (CR/NC). No grade lower than a “B” will be accepted towards satisfying the master’s degree requirements. The average of all grades for courses taken while pursuing a CS graduate degree must have at least a B average (i.e., a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0). While a course with a passing grade lower than B will count in the GPA, it will not count toward degree requirements. A UVA BS/BA student who has completed acceptable CS graduate courses that were not used to satisfy the BS/BA requirement can request to use UVA CS graduate courses to fulfill the requirements of our master’s curriculum. A non-UVA BS/BA student who has completed acceptable CS graduate courses that were not used to satisfy the non-UVA BS/BA requirement can request a transfer of a maximum of 6 graduate credits. Whether any individual transfer course counts toward our master’s degree requirements is determined by the MGPD.

University of Rochester,"University of Rochester Search Rochester.edu Popular Searches Resources for Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences Section Navigation The master’s program offers students a high level of flexibility. Students may focus on one area of computer science, or take courses across the breadth of the field. The degree may be completed on a full-time or part-time basis. For students with an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field, the requirements can usually be completed over the course of three semesters. We welcome applications from students who did not major in computer science but whose undergraduate work demonstrates strong technical skills. This program is for students who intend to complete their studies at the University of Rochester with an MS degree. Students with an undergraduate degree who wish to get their PhD in computer science at Rochester should apply directly to the PhD program. For application and financial support information see theapplying to Rochester page. Students must complete a minimum of 30 credits. Of these credits: MS students must pass a comprehensive examination (or essay), typically in the last semester before graduation. Some students may need to take one or more 100- or 200-level prerequisite courses. These courses are not counted toward the 30 credit requirement and are typically taken by students who do not have an undergraduate degree in computer science. Courses offered by departments other than computer science but that are relevant to the degree may be included in the 30 hours, subject to approval of the graduate education committee.In any case, at least 18 hours of the 30 must be courses offered by the Department of Computer Science. Students must maintain a GPA of 3.0 by the end of their second semester and throughout the rest of their time in the program, and must obtain a least a 2.0 in each course that counts toward the 30 credit hours.

University of Arizona,"Please review theGraduate College Admission Requirements, which are in addition to the departmental admission requirements below. Admission to the program is determined by high scores on standardized tests, an adequate background in computer science, strong letters of recommendation, high-level grades from a strong undergraduate program, and research interests shared with the faculty. Each applicant is evaluated carefully based on the entire application package, taking into account test scores, previous educational achievement, letters of recommendation, and the statement of purpose.  The admissions committee also considers an applicant’s previous research, publications, and work experience. The stated minimums are guidelines. An applicant whose record is weak in one aspect (e.g., GRE scores) may be considered for admission if a strength exists in another area (e.g., excellent GPA, letters). In evaluating students applications, the committee looks for the following: (1) adequate math and computer science background, (2) excellent academic performance, (3) good communication skills, and (4) intellectual potential. The admissions committee will also consider whether applicants have researched the University of Arizona Computer Science program and are applying to work in research areas and with the expertise of the faculty currently in the Department of Computer Science. Applicants for admission are evaluated on the basis of academic record, preparation, and other relevant qualifications. Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field. A well-prepared applicant should be proficient in a high-level programming language such as C, C++, or Java, and have a solid background in the following areas: (1) mathematics, including calculus and discrete mathematics; (2) machine architecture; (3) programming languages, including exposure to a variety of high-level languages (e.g., Java, LISP); (4) data structures; (5) algorithm analysis; (6) theory of computation; and (7) software systems, including compilers and operating systems. In particular, all students must have at a minimum demonstrated advanced undergraduate studies in Systems (i.e. through an operating systems or compilers course) and Theory (i.e. through an algorithms or theory of computation course). If an applicant lacks the academic background to apply to the graduate program, prerequisites can be completed at another institution or at UA as a non-degree-seeking graduate student prior to application. Non-degree-seeking graduate students can take undergraduate and graduate level courses at the University of Arizona’s campus, if space is available. Note:1) International applicants are usually not eligible fornon-degree seekingstatus because of visa requirements. 2) There is no guarantee of admission to the graduate program based on completion of the prerequisites at the University of Arizona. Typical minimum undergraduate GPA for MS applicants is 3.2 out of a 4.0 scale.

Vanderbilt University,"Finding your own course of study and research within a university's existing programs can be difficult. You might have solid math and science skills as an engineer, but your interests lean more towards an entrepreneurial or civic-minded direction. In IMS, you can tailor your own PhD program from a wide variety of courses that span the educational spectrum. Our interdisciplinary approach allows students to interface and collaborate with professors and faculties from Chemistry, Physics, School of Medicine and all engineering departments. Through VINSE, the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, IMS students and faculty have access to a state-of-the-art cleanroom, advanced imaging and nanofabrication facilities. Whether it's new materials and energy sources or modeling and simulation, our work is fueled by the freedom our researchers have to work across disciplines and collaborate to find new solutions to some of society's most pressing problems. The interdisciplinary M.S. degree requires a minimum of 24 semester hours (beyond the Baccalaureate) of formal coursework as outlined below for the Ph.D. Degree, plus a thesis signed by two faculty members. At least 6 additional semester hours in graduate research must also be completed. The thesis is expected to be defended in a public setting with questions from the committee and public attendees as in a Ph.D. defense. No qualifying exam is required. The semester hours will include at least three of the four core program courses. The core consists of: The IMS Ph.D. degree requires a total of 72 hours with a minimum of 24 hours of formal coursework, of which 15 hours will be from the IMS core. Students must complete each course with a grade of B or higher. The IMS core courses must be taken in the first semester in which the course is available. The course consists of five fundamental areas. The Materials Fundamentals course is required of all IMS graduate students. From the remaining four areas, a student must select one from three different areas. Within each selection, the student has options as to which course fulfills that requirement as shown below. The core consists of: The remainder of the 72 hours can be taken as dissertation research, coursework, or transfer credit (if applicable). Performance in dissertation research does not affect the student’s GPA. However, it is critical to note that until 72 hours is reached that a full 9-credit hours are taken each semester. This may be all in research, all in courses and seminar, or some combination thereof. All students are required to take 9 credit hours of elective courses. These can be selected from any courses within the School of Engineering or Science-related Graduate classes within Arts & Sciences. Additional courses taken from within a single core focus area (e.g. taking CHEM 5610 and 5040) will qualify as an elective course. Below we highlight courses currently listed within many focus areas to serve as a guide to students in selecting their electives. Students are under no obligation to choose courses from the below lists and the availability of these courses is subject to change without notice depending on the prerogatives of the listing department. First year students will participate in a series of three research rotations. Each research rotation will last 10 weeks with the expectation that approximately 9 hours per week should be devotedto working with the research group. Since the semesters are almost 15 weeks in length, thesecond rotation would span the end of the fall and the beginning of the spring semesters. Areport summarizing the research conducted during the rotation will be submitted uponcompletion of each 10-week rotation to the IMS director and shared with the faculty memberwho advised the research rotation. The report should be written as if the work were to besubmitted to an appropriate conference related to the field of study. Format.The report should be 1 to 3 single-spaced pages in length (including figures and tables) formatted as: title, author list (you as first author along with any students that helped with your training and your advisors), author affiliations, date, and short abstract (~200 words). Use 11- or 12-point size in a Roman font. Content.Typical sections include: Style.Make sure the report tells a compelling story. Every good scientific article clearly explains in the introduction a scientific question to be answered in the article and places the question into context of what the community already knows. The methods or theory section then describes how the effort attempts to address the question posed in the introduction.Finally, the results and discussion provide the answer to your question with a logical development of ideas. Because every story is different, feel free to modify the structure of your report to best tell the story. To proceed with study for the M.S. or Ph.D. degree in the IMS program, a student must demonstrate proficiency in the fundamentals of materials science, proficiency in the corresponding fields involved in the candidate's dissertation research and demonstrate the potential for conducting high-quality original research by fulfilling the following two requirements. The test should be administered after the student’s second academic semester and before the last day of classes of their third academic semester. Failure to sit for the exam before the end of their third semester will result in an automatic “U” for that semester. Extensions beyond the end of the third semester will be considered on a case-by-case basis, but in all cases must be completed prior to the start of the fourth semester. For students who have transferred from another graduate institution, scheduling of the exam will be established on an individual basis, but the test must be taken within 12 months of beginning studies at Vanderbilt. If a student fails any component of the exam, the Advisory Committee can grant the student a second chance at their discretion. If a second chance is granted, the second test, which will have the same format, must be retaken within 3 months. A second failure will result in termination from the Ph.D. program. The Qualifying Examination will be given in accordance with the regulations of the Graduate School and administered by the Ph.D. committee. The exam will consist of a written dissertation proposal, an oral presentation of the proposal and defense of the proposal. The oral segment may include an examination of concepts both directly and indirectly related to the dissertation proposal. Students should complete the Qualifying Examination after 24 graduate hours and within 42 months of beginning graduate study in the IMS. The examination can be taken a maximum of two times. For students with any other prior graduate work, the timeline for Ph.D. qualifying exam can be established on an individual basis. In the oral qualifying examination, the student should The formal request for appointment to the qualifying examination committee must be received by the Graduate School at least two weeks prior to the date of the examination. Forms for this request are available in the program office. The final examination is a public oral defense of the student’s thesis presented before the Ph.D. committee and the public in accordance with the Graduate School requirements. The student must pass the oral and the dissertation must be approved by the committee. These two requirements do not have to be concurrent. The student can take the oral examination a maximum of two times. The dissertation is considered approved once it has been signed by all committee members. In general, the final oral examination will be conducted in two parts. The first consists of a public presentation of the thesis followed by questions from the gallery. The second will be in the form of a question period attended by the Ph.D. committee and invited faculty only, which may include one faculty member external to Vanderbilt who is directly participating in the student's dissertation research. As indicated previously, any external members must be approved by the advisors and director prior to setting a date for the oral exam. While participation of faculty is preferred to take place in person, virtual attendance can be acceptable under some conditions. Approval for such conditions will be made on a case-by-case basis by the IMS director or if deemed necessary by the University leadership. It is anticipated that the five-member committee chosen for the Oral examination will be used for the final defense. If changes are made after the Oral exam, approval of all changes must be obtained from the IMS Director along with a brief statement concerning why the change(s) was (were) made. The student shall submit, no later than two weeks before the end of the final exam period of the term in which the student expects to graduate, two approved copies of the thesis to the Graduate School office, one to the program office and one to each of the thesis advisors. Approval requires at least five signatures on the thesis title page of members of the Ph.D. committee. The candidate shall also furnish an abstract of the thesis, not to exceed 250 words in length, to the Graduate School office. Both hard and soft copies of the documents may be accepted depending on graduate school guidance and advisor preference. Signatures may be electronic. During the first semester, all incoming students are required to attend the professional development seminar series. This is not a registered course. Students are expected to attend all professional development presentations, unless given an excused absence. Topics include: This information in thisGraduate Student Handbookis intended to supplement and expand upon the regulations of the Vanderbilt Graduate School and the School of Engineering. However, specific research paths, expectations, and other requirements may be imposed by and are at the discretion of the research advisor. The acronym IMS (Interdisciplinary Materials Science) is used to identify the program and in the course catalog to identify courses specific to the program. Huijin An Thesis Advisor: Andrea Locke (Biomedical Engineering) & Sharon Weiss (Electrical and Computer Engineering)Research: Optical biosensors are powerful analytical instruments to measure biomolecular interactions in real-time, label free. My research is focused on synthesizing porous silicon-based sensor membranes that can be conjugated with diverse nanoparticles such as gold and functionalized by diverse molecules for sensing specific diseases, using different spectroscopic methods such as Raman spectroscopy or reflectance measurement. Ultimate goal of my research is designing an optical biosensor which can be used at the point of care.Undergraduate: Incheon National University, Nano Bioengineering Kellen Arnold Thesis Advisor: Sharon Weiss (Electrical and Computer Engineering) & Robert Reed (Electrical and Computer Engineering) & Richard Haglund (Physics & Astronomy)Research: Several decades ago, fiber optics was adopted for long-distance communications, where fiber bundles were laid across the ocean floor sending light-speed, high bandwidth signals around the planet. Data demands across the world are ever increasing, which initiates a need to offer optical data processing for data centers and even co-packaged with computer chips. This is where my research comes in - I work in the field of silicon photonics, where we examine fundamental light-matter interactions and on-chip optical components. My work includes simulation, design, fabrication, and testing of nanoscale devices that will continue to meet our growing terrestrial and aerospace requirements for photonic integrated circuits.Undergraduate: SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Nanoscale Engineering and Applied Mathematics Bradly Baer Thesis Advisor: Greg Walker (Mechanical Engineering)Research: My current research is on phonons in superlattices of semiconductor materials.  Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), I am modeling the phonons in AlN/GaN superlattices to determine how the interfaces between the layers affect the phonons and thus the macroscopic properties of the material.  As nanofabrication techniques continue to improve, a better understanding of the phonon behavior in these layered materials can be used to guide the design and development of new materials with interesting thermal and optical properties.Undergraduate: Point Loma Nazarene College, ChemistryMasters: Vanderbilt University, Interdisciplinary Materials Science Emma Bartelsen Thesis Advisor: Josh Caldwell (Mechanical Engineering)Research: Greenhouse gases trap some of Earth’s outgoing energy, thus retaining heat in the atmosphere, and altering our planet’s climate and weather patterns. These changes have boundless repercussions that affect human health, agriculture, water resources, forests, wildlife, and coastal areas. Since 1970, atmospheric methane has increased by 150%, carbon dioxide emissions have increased by over 90%, and nitrous oxide has increased by 24%. We are limited in our ability to reliably track and quantify these emissions as there are only 50 cooperative National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration air sampling sites around the world, collecting about 14,000 air samples annually. Therefore, I aim to design a low-footprint, multi-gas sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle, capable of collecting accurate, stable, and temporally efficient measurements at higher acquisition rates, over more expansive areas. The design of this sensor will work towards providing the data necessary to make informed decisions to better our environment for future generations.Undergraduate: University of Kansas, Mechanical Engineering Jeb Buchner First Year StudentUndergraduate: Auburn University, Materials Engineering Emily Byrum First Year StudentUndergraduate: Arizona State University, Biophysics Nicholas 'Cal' Craven Thesis Advisors: Clare McCabe (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering) Kane Jennings (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering)Research: I work in the area of Molecular Dynamics Simulations. These simulations rely on statistical mechanics fundamentals to provide heuristic accuracy for complex chemical situations. While experimental techniques, such as in-situ microscopy, continue to significantly improve, simulations provide much clearer insight due to the collection of each atom's trajectory throughout a process. Furthermore, the scalability of these simulations allows for efficient screening of complex parameter space to focus in on a chemical subset of interest. My project looks at polymer thin film coatings and their stimulated responses to common solvents. This has applications within the field of smart sensors and coatings.Undergraduate: Ohio State University, Chemical Engineering Katja Diaz-Granados Thesis Advisor: Josh Caldwell (Mechanical Engineering)Research: My primary interest is in studying ways in which the crystal symmetries of various naturally occurring materials can be harnessed to tailor thermal emission and near-field radiative heat transport. A unique class of materials are those with an extreme form of anisotropy that exhibit either a metallic or dielectric-like optical response depending on the crystal axis of interest. These hyperbolic materials offer an opportunity for the sub-diffractional confinement of light using an electromagnetic mode consisting of light coupled with lattice vibrations to form a volume confined hyperbolic phonon polariton. These hyperbolic phonon polaritons propagate at fixed angles that depend on the frequency, making them ideal candidates for research on directing radiative heat transfer across interfaces.Undergraduate: Harvard-Radcliffe, Integrative Biology Jeremy Espano Thesis Advisor: Janet Macdonald (Chemistry)Research: My research investigates the ways in which we can controllably synthesize different phases of metal chalcogenide nanoparticles. Nanoparticle phase is an important but overlooked aspect of nanoparticle design due to its heavy influence on the properties and applications of the synthesized nanoparticles. We manipulate precursor kinetics, decomposition mechanisms, solvent interactions, and temperature in order to observe its effects on bottom-up nanoparticle synthesis. By doing so we can observe and unravel interesting kinetic and thermodynamic trends. This information will help add on to the field and help expand on basic nanoparticle principles like LaMer’s nucleation theory and Ostwald’s rule of stages. Finally, by achieving phase control, we are one step closer in facilitating the emergence of next generation nanoparticle technologies in a wide variety of fields.Undergraduate: Boston College, Chemistry Matthew Galazzo Thesis Advisor: David Cliffel (Chemistry)Research: Photosystem I, one of the two major proteins responsible for photosynthesis in plants, can be integrated without loss of function into a variety of traditional electrode materials. Due to lack of orientation and kinetic limitations, its efficiency is greatly reduced, yielding currents in the nanoampere range and making it unsuitable for practical application. I fabricate microfluidic devices that make use of a higher surface area to volume ratio and control of flow conditions to improve electrochemical mediator conversion. Improved conversion has implications for Photosystem I in solar energy for small devices, potential redox flow battery membranes, or chemical synthesis.Undergraduate: California Polytechnic State University-Pomona, Chemical EngineeringMasters: Fisk University, Chemistry Elizabeth Hays First Year StudentUndergraduate: Murray State University, Biochemistry Tao Hong Thesis Advisor: Deyu Li (Mechanical Engineering)Research: My research project focuses on integrating metasurface and microfluidics for multifunctional bioimaging and sensing. The conventional spectroscopy and microscopy techniques for cell-level biosensing and imaging relay on bulky and expensive components including beam splitters, filters, waveplates, prisms, and mirrors. The structure of conventional integrated optical system is not modularized to adapt new configuration and thus only limited to few combinable functions. Unlike conventional optical components, metasurface is structured by subwavelength-spaced planar phase shifters, which forms miniature interfaces for accurate wavefront manipulation of light. By taking the advantage of compatibility of metasurface and microfluidics, I am working on developing integrable modules with various cell-level optical biosensing and imaging functions. By combining modules with different functions, a comprehensive investigation of cellular species and processes on a miniature and inexpensive system will be beneficial for early cancer detection and disease recognition in underdeveloped areas.Undergraduate: Cornell University, Materials Science and Engineering Sajal Islam Thesis Advisor: Ronald Schrimpf (Electrical and Computer Engineering)Research: In my research, I delve into the realm of device physics, specifically focusing on exploring single-event effects—a type of radiation impact—on wideband gap semiconductor devices. One critical aspect is the investigation of single-event burnout (SEB), a phenomenon that can lead to instant catastrophic failure in devices exposed to radiation environments, such as those encountered in space missions. My focus at Vanderbilt, under the guidance of Prof. Ron Schrimpf and with funding from the Air Force Center of Excellence, is on understanding the radiation response of Ga2O3. Collaboratively, I engage in projects with colleagues working on SiC (funded by NASA) and GaN, aiming to meet new-generation space standards and enhance radiation-hardening techniques. I've already published a co-authored and a first-authored paper, with several other papers currently under review. I've had the opportunity to present my findings through oral presentations at various conferences, including NSREC 2023, ROCS-CSMANTECH, DRC-2023, and the NASA Glenn Meeting.Undergraduate: Primeasia University, Electrical and Electronic EngineeringMasters: Missouri State University, Materials Science Vikash Khokhar First Year StudentUndergraduate: S.S. Jain Subodh PG CollegeMasters: Central University of Punjab, Quantum Mechanics Elena Kovalik Thesis Advisor: Jason Valentine (Mechanical Engineering)Research:  In the Valentine group we study metamaterials- nanostructured materials with engineered optical properties. Of particular interest are dynamic metamaterials, which can tune or switch their optical response with an external stimulus. My research exists at the intersection of nanophotonics and electrochemistry, focusing on electrochemically modulated dynamic metamaterials. My work uses electrochemical methods- such as intercalation or redox reactions- to tune metamaterials in the visible spectrum. These projects are being pursued for application in next-generation reflective displays.Undergraduate: University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, Physics Ryan Kowalski Thesis Advisor: Josh Caldwell (Mechanical Engineering)Research: My research focuses on investigating the local dielectric properties of single-photon emitting point defects in wide bandgap semiconductors (e.g. diamond nitrogen-vacancy center), which are an exceptionally promising physical platform for quantum information sciences. Using infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and nanoscale Fourier transform infrared (nano-FTIR), surface defects can be identified both spectrally and spatially with highly sub-diffractional resolution (<20 nm). Correlating the s-SNOM data with photoluminescence spectroscopy will provide a non-destructive and high-throughout characterization technique to determine the chemical structure of single-photon emitting point defects.Undergraduate: University of Massachusetts - Amherst, Mechanical Engineering Qiuyao Li Thesis Advisor: De-en Jiang (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering)Research: The escalating demand for batteries with high energy density, prolonged cycle life, and cost-efficiency, as required for applications ranging from smartphones to electric vehicles, underscores the critical need for alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries. To address this, my research employs density functional theory calculations to model and analyze the intricate interface interactions between electrolytes and electrodes. This approach allows us to investigate the underlying mechanisms, encompassing aspects of geometry, energetics, and electronic structure. Our goal is to elucidate the intercalation processes, providing valuable insights to support the development of innovative battery materials.Undergraduate: Sichuan University, PhysicsMasters: University of Science and Technology of China, Physics Jack Loken First Year StudentUndergraduate: University of Wisconsin, Madison - Mechanical Engineering Mackey 'Trey"" Long III Thesis Advisor: Josh Caldwell (Mechanical Engineering)Research: Maxwell Planck devised the original theory of thermal radiation from a perfect black body. This theory has held more many years, aiding in the development of a plethora of technologies and applications and to the beginnings of our understanding of the quantized energy levels in quantum mechanics. Nearly a century later, it was discovered that two bodies separated by sub-mircometer distances exist within each other's near-field electromagnetic regime and do not subscribe to the theory of Black Body Radiation as prescribed by Planck's Law of far-field radiation. My research is in the understanding of near-field radiative heat transfer across solid-state, nanoscale separations towards applications of improved thermophotovoltaic devices, heat-assisted magnetic recording, nanolithography, and advanced thermal management systems for more reliable integrated circuits and NEMS devices.Undergraduate: Auburn University, Materials Science and Engineering Mark Mc Veigh Thesis Advisor: Leon Bellan (Mechanical Engineering)Research: Positron emission tomography (PET) is an incredibly powerful diagnostic procedure that holds the potential for clinicians to track virtually any biological process using specific radiotracers. There have been thousands of radiotracers developed but due to the high cost of synthesis, clinicians rely on only one radiotracer for over 95% of PET scans. I am working on developing a microfluidic synthesis platform that will reduce the cost of radiotracer production and employ a dose-on-demand methodology, allowing clinicians to choose the radiotracer that best suits the needs of the patient. The platform uses inexpensive microfluidic chips that contain multiple channels and chambers to execute all necessary synthesis steps. By optimizing the chip architecture and implementing automated fluidic handling, we are working towards being able to synthesize any radiotracer rapidly and inexpensively.Undergraduate: Northeastern University, Chemical EngineeringMasters: Northeastern University, Chemical Engineering Owen Meilander Thesis Advisor: Mona Ebrish (Electrical and Computer Engineering)Research:  To deal with the growing power demand, high efficiency power electronics are needed. While silicon devices are highly matured, in high power applications their intrinsic material properties lead to large devices with significant ant power losses. Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, such as gallium nitride (GaN), promise up to a 1000x increase in efficiency at high voltages, but material defects have limited the advancement of these devices. My research focuses on the identification of defects in GaN through the use of spectroscopic techniques and fabrication of GaN devices. My work will help to correlate these defects to device operation, resulting in more efficient and reliable devices.Undergraduate: Westminster College, Physics & Mathematics Madison Miller Thesis Advisor: Dan Fleetwood (Electrical and Computer Engineering)Undergraduate: University of Florida, Materials Science and Engineering Nichole Moehring Thesis Advisor: Piran Kidambi (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering)Research: My research focuses on investigating the proton conductivity of two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Pristine graphene and h-BN represent the fundamentally thinnest possible membranes, and are impermeable to gases as small as He but allow subatomic species, such protons, to pass through. After synthesizing these materials using chemical vapor deposition, I use electrochemical tests to investigate the transport of protons through these 2D lattices. Understanding the transport of protons through 2D crystals will enable applications in proton exchange membranes, isotope separations, and artificial photosynthesis.Undergraduate: University of Wisconsin - Stout, Applied Science with Materials and Nanoscience Concentration Kieran Nehil-Puleo Thesis Advisors: Peter Cummings (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering) & Zhongyue Yang (Chemistry)Research: Combinatorial space of chemicals is vast; the set of molecules made of up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, and S totals at 166.4 billion. I work on intelligently exploring and characterizing the chemical space of soft matter materials using statistical machine learning methods and physical multi-scale simulations. My primary project involves the optimization of the properties of chimeric, protein-based biomaterials. Protein-based materials have many applications in the biomedical field due to their excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties. With a growing need for sustainability, protein-based materials may help phase out the widespread use of petroleum-based plastics.Undergraduate: Michigan State University, Materials Science and Engineering & Statistics Vivian Nwosu-Madueke Thesis Advisor: Carlos Silvera Batista (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering)Research: The manipulation and control of colloidal nanoparticles have become increasingly important in various fields, including materials science, biology, and medicine. This is attributed to the fact that colloidal materials display impressive features such as dynamic assembly and self-propulsion, which are promising for achieving advanced materials that mimic the versatility of natural systems. Electric fields have been widely used to tune the transport and interparticle interactions of colloidal materials, however combined electrical and chemical forces are not well understood. Studies have confirmed the hypothesis that crafting gradients of electroactive species through ac faradaic reactions leads to versatile long-range interactions under electrodiffusiophoresis (EDP). However, there is limited research on colloidal dynamics under simultaneous electrical potential and complex concentration gradients. Hence, the goal of my project is to understand the electrochemical taxis of nanoparticles. In addition, this project aims to demonstrate the use of EDP for precise control and manipulation of nanoparticles under complex pH patterns, generated using light-addressable electrodes. Leveraging the ability to effect long-range transport through EDP will advance fundamental knowledge in the field of AC electrokinetics and colloidal science, and will extend the capabilities of techniques to trap and analyze nanoscale objects for applications in separation, focusing, and trapping in lab-on-a-chip devices.Undergraduate: University of Lagos, Chemistry Johanna Pearson First Year StudentUndergraduate: Case Western Reserve University, Neuroscience Courtney Ragle Thesis Advisors: Lauren Buchanan (Chemistry) & Josh Caldwell (Mechanical Engineering)Research: My work takes place within the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, where vibrational and phonon polaritons (quasi-particles melding together light and matter) flourish. These polariton systems show promise for understanding and manipulating molecular dynamics within organic materials and biologically relevant molecules, as well as exploring polariton assisted nanoscale energy transfer. I work to create cavity systems with decreasing mode volumes to enhance energy transfer and push into the ultra-strong coupling regime. The studies employ two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR) and scattering near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) as the main instruments of exploration. Undergraduate: Fort Lewis College, Chemistry Aditha Senarath Thesis Advisors: Josh Caldwell (Mechanical Engineering) & Ronald Schrimpf (Electrical and Computer Engineering)Research: Wide-bandgap semiconductors are gaining interest in high-power, high-temperature, and high-frequency applications due to their excellent electrical properties. Besides that, wide-bandgap materials such as b-Ga2O3 can be used in micro and nano-electronic devices to increase the device's radiation hardness. From outer space to airplane avionics to accelerators and nuclear power plants, radiation impacts in electronics are a severe concern for the performance and survivability of systems. My primary research focuses on characterizing and identifying radiation-induced defects in wide-bandgap semiconductor devices. Understanding the correlation between those defects and the electrical properties in micro and nano-devices is crucial because when the size of electronic devices shrinks and the device contains a few thousand atoms, a single defect can cause it to stop working. This project will help to develop future micro and nano-devices with high radiation hardness.Undergraduate: University of Peradeniya, PhysicsMasters: Wright State University, Physics Rahul Shah Thesis Advisor: Jason Valentine (Mechanical Engineering)Research: The modern world is driven by an insatiable demand for detailed information. From understanding the complex interplay of proteins in medical diagnosis, to identifying early onset of plant diseases for agriculture, spectral information is a game changer. This is my research. I aim to develop next-generation spectrometers with cutting-edge metasurfaces. My work includes theoretical modelling and simulations, to hands on fabrication and characterization, using the tools available to me through VINSE.Undergraduate: Indian Institute of Science - Bangalore, Materials ScienceMasters: Indian Institute of Science - Bangalore, Materials Science Soren Smail Thesis Advisor: Sharon Weiss (Electrical and Computer Engineering)Undergraduate: University of Cincinnati, Biochemistry Haohong Song Thesis Advisor: De-en Jiang (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering)Research: My research focuses on computational materials chemistry, molecular dynamics simulations, atomic level modeling and catalyst systems. Recently, my primary research interest lies in the realm of computational catalysis, focusing on the intricate dynamics and underlying mechanisms of catalytic processes across various scales - from monoatomic to diatomic and polyatomic systems. By delving deep into these systems, I aim to unveil the fundamental principles governing catalytic efficiency and selectivity, thereby paving the way for the design of more effective and sustainable catalytic materials and processes.Undergraduate: University of Science and Technology of China, Polymer Chemistry Brayden Terry Thesis Advisor: Al Strauss (Mechanical Engineering)Research: The Vanderbilt University Welding Automation Lab (VUWAL) focuses on studying advanced joining processes with a focus on Friction Stir Welding and its derivative processes. As a solid-state joining process, friction stir welding allows for joining of materials that are not weldable by traditional liquid-state means as well as joining of dissimilar materials. Major applications of friction stir welding are found in the aerospace and automotive industries. My research focuses on the creation of metal matrix composites via friction stir processing, a derivative of FSW, and application of FSW to shape memory alloys. Metal matrix composites can provide improved material properties over base materials by including hard strengthening particles suspended in the host material. Shape memory alloys have been used in aerospace as actuators on both regular aircraft and spacecraft and are being explored for uses as vibration dampeners and smart wing technologies.Undergraduate: Colorado School of Mines, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Maxwell Ugwu First Year StudentUndergraduate: University of Nigeria Matthew Vasuta Thesis Advisors: Kane Jennings (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering) & Shihong Lin (Civil Engineering)Research: Distillation has dominated the separation of organic mixtures for decades despite its high thermal energy requirement. In an effort to reduce this impact, I work on synthesizing polymer thin films that act as distillation substitutes by separating water from a polar organic at cooler temperatures. The synthesis method we employ in my lab is unique as it uses a catalyst-laden substrate to spin coat and polymerize the film at the same time, allowing us to create films in minutes with very minimal solvent. This versatility makes it so a variety of different films with various functionalities can be quickly synthesized for water-polar organic separation, each with exciting compositional, wetting, environmental, and separating properties.Undergraduate: University of Tennessee - Knoxville, Chemical Engineering Harrison Walker Thesis Advisors: Sokrates Pantelides (Physics) & Josh Caldwell (Mechanical Engineering)Undergraduate: Auburn University, Materials Science and EngineeringResearch: Electron energy loss spectroscopy in the monochromated transmission electron microscope provides both incredible spatial and energy resolution, allowing for detailed studies of low energy excitations in materials, such as phonons. Employing this experimental technique, my research delves into the study of phonons in superlattices, offering insights into phonon-mediated heat transport and topological phenomena. To provide complementary theory, I also utilize density functional theory and molecular dynamics to train machine learning force fields capable of predicting the potential energy surface of material systems. From the predicted potential energy surface, the phonon dispersion can be calculated and compared with experimental measurements. By bridging experimental observations with cutting-edge theoretical models, I aim to elucidate mechanisms that can influence the performance and efficiency of future electronic and thermoelectric devices. Christopher Whittington Thesis Advisor: Sharon Weiss (Electrical and Computer Engineering)Research: In the face of escalating data demands, electronic components alone struggle to meet society's growing data transmission needs. To overcome this challenge, we turn to the power of light – by harnessing photons, we have the potential to achieve astonishingly rapid data transmission speeds, exceeding a terabyte per second. My research is dedicated to crafting nanoscale photonic components using silicon and silicon nitride. These components find applications in optical filters, switches, and the promising realm of photonic-based quantum computing.Undergraduate: Clark University, Physics Alexis Yates Thesis Advisors: Ethan Lippmann (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering) & Angela Jefferson (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center)Research: The impact of neurovascular health on abnormal brain aging and cognitive impairment has been recognized as a major contributor to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. My research is focused on the hemodynamic contributions to VCID. In particular, I am examining brain endothelial cell (BEC) mechanobiology through the response of BECs to elevated shear stress and altered extracellular matrix environments. I utilize biomaterials and stem cell culture techniques to fabricate bioengineered vascular models, constructed from a biomimetic hydrogel which has been shown to support neural cell growth and maturation. My work consists of designing and fabricating bioreactors, cell culture (primarily iPS-derived endothelial cells), hydrogel synthesis, and the atomic force microscopy to characterize material properties.Undergraduate: Biola University, Biochemistry Our interdisciplinary approach allows students to interface and collaborate with faculty from engineering, physics, chemistry and medicine.  As a result, our graduates are highly marketable and have gone on to successful careers at a diverse range of institutions. 42% of our gradautes have gone to work in industry (Johnson & Johnson, Dow, DuPont, Exxon and Biotech start-ups) 35% have stayed in academia and 23% work in the government (FDA, NIH, US Patent Office).

George Mason University,"Doctoral students in Computer Science are selected on the basis of scholarship and research potential from among applicants with appropriate degrees. The minimum requirements for admissions are as follows: Admission to the PhD program is competitive and satisfying the minimum requirements listed above does not guarantee admission. To apply, go to theGMU Graduate Admissionsweb site. Please do not submit a hardcopy to the Computer Science Department. Applicants who request financial assistance are encouraged to apply for Fall admission. Late applications are placed on a waiting list and are considered if space is available, only after all on-time applications have been evaluated. Foreign students are urged to submit applications early, because their processing takes longer than for US applicants, due in part to the need to evaluate overseas transcripts (a service provided for free by the University). Applicants who meet the December 1 deadline will be notified of their admission status approximately in mid-March (for Fall admission). Admission can rarely be deferred. Applicants must indicate the semester in which they wish to begin the program. If an applicant does not enroll in the semester admitted, and does not contact the Graduate Admissions office before the start of the semester, the offer of admission is voided. If an applicant decides to enter the program at a later time, a new application must be submitted. More Questions? See thePhD Admissions FAQfor answers to frequently answered questions.

Clemson University,"Application to the School of Computing’s Computer Science MS program requires official GRE scores for both US and international applicants. This requirement cannot be waived.Additionally, students applying to the Computer Science MS should know that School of Computing funding is reserved for PhD study. Because of this, applicants admitted to the Computer Science MS should expect to pay full tuition. For a database of external funding opportunities, clickhere. The Master of Science program in Computer Science, available at Clemson,Greenville, andCharleston- hybrid-online,prepares individuals for a Ph.D. program, research careers in industry, or advanced technical positions in industry and government. The program is designed for students who offer evidence of above average scholastic ability at the undergraduate level. Completion of the M.S. program normally requires from one and one-half years to two years beyond the undergraduate degree but may require additional time for students whose undergraduate degree is in an area other than computer science. For students awarded assistantships, two academic years are usually required for the completion of the M.S. degree. For students to be accepted into the M.S. program, including the approval of an M.S. en route to a Ph.D. degree, they must have a background equivalent to theMSCS Readysequence. Students without the necessary background should either first apply as non-degree students and complete the MSCS Ready sequence, or they should complete the equivalent of MSCS Ready before applying as a degree-seeking student. Questions related to application and selection can be sent tomscs@clemson.edu. The requirements for the M.S. are based on 30 credits, which may be obtained through either: In this option, a student is required to complete ten approved courses. There is no thesis presentation or comprehensive examination required for the degree. The thesis option is designed for students who have a strong interest in research and who can complete an original and creative research project. The quality of the research and presentation should be such that the thesis or a derivative work is acceptable for publication in a refereed conference proceeding or archival journal. The final examination is an oral examination conducted by the student's Advisory Committee. The student is expected to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of both the research results presented and the pre- existing body of knowledge that the results extend. Of the 30 credits required for graduation, the thesis-option student must have 6 credits of CPSC 8910. The student must also meet the Concentration and Breadth Requirements as defined below in the remaining 24 credits of coursework. A student may take more than six credits of CPSC 8910, but only six credits may be applied toward the degree. During the M.S. program, the student will choose a concentration of study in one of six core areas and will choose courses in at least two other core areas for breadth: Concentration Requirement:Each student must take at least three courses in one core area. These courses can be selected from the courses listed in the table below or from approved CPSC 8810 special topics courses in that area. Breadth Requirement:Each student must take one course in at least two other core areas. * CPSC 6110, 6160, 6180, 6620, 8480, and 8620 span core areas but will count in only one core area each For the course titles of each course, please seecourses of instruction. For syllabi, please seesyllabus repository. Computer Science M.S. students can enroll in a maximum of 12 credit hours per Fall and Spring semesters. There are four considerations when selecting courses for an M.S. plan of study. 6000/8000/9000-Level Credits: For coursework-only students, at least 18 of the 30 credits must be at the 8000- or 9000-level. For thesis students, at least 21 of the 30 credits must be at the 8000- or 9000-level. For thesis students, six of their 8000/9000-level credits will be CPSC 8910. Courses Outside the School of Computing:Coursework-only students may include up to 12 credits of approved courses from outside the School of Computing. Thesis students may include up to 9 credits of approved courses from outside the School of Computing. Transfer Credits: Both coursework-only and thesis students may include up to 9 credits of approved computing courses transferred from another university. Transfer courses will be counted among the approved courses outside the School of Computing but will be listed as CPSC 6999 or CPSC 8999 on the student's GS2-plan of study. Course Exclusions: Of the 30 credits of approved courses required for graduation, students may not include credits for CPSC 6810, 6890, 74xx, 8880, 95x0, 9810, or 9910; DPA 6000-6030, 6810-6830, 8600, 8800, or 8910; or HCC 8880, 9500, or 9910. Additionally, only six credits of CPSC 6820 or CPSC/DPA/HCC 8810 can be included, with the exception of CPSC 8810 MSCS Ready modules, which cannot be counted toward the Computer Science M.S. 30 credit requirement.

University of Iowa,"Admission to our graduate programs is based on a rigorous and competitive selection process, that considers undergraduate performance, standardized test scores, and letters of recommendation. Candidates are advised to apply directly to the program best suited to their academic goal. Students interested in pursuing research or academic careers should apply to the PhD program, while those seeking additional preparation, beyond their undergraduate training, for industrial careers should apply to the MCS program. Our department does not admit students directly to the MS program. Students applying to the PhD program need not have a master's degree prior to admission. PhD candidates may opt to receive an MS or MCS degree while working towards the PhD, although there is no requirement to do so. Students who hold a master's degree upon entering the PhD program may apply for transfer credit of their master’s courses towards the PhD program requirements. Students applying to the PhD program who are not selected for admission will automatically be considered for admission to the MCS program if they do not already hold a master's degree. To apply online, go to theUI Graduate and Professional Admissionswebsite.Deadline for applications to the MCS and PhD program for Fall 2024 was Jan 1, 2024. After you submit your application, you will receive email instructions on how to establish your HawkID and password in order to access your Admissions Profile on MyUI, our online portal for students. All supporting materials can and should be uploaded through your Admissions Profile. If your academic program requires letters of recommendation, you will be asked to provide the contact information of your recommenders on your Profile. The recommender will then receive an email from the Office of Admissions instructing them on how to upload a recommendation letter and/or recommendation form. Applicants for admission to the graduate program must meet the admission requirements of the Graduate College; see theManual of Rules and Regulations of the Graduate Collegeon the Graduate College website. NOTE: We regret that we are unable to evaluate any individual’s probability of admission prior to formal application beyond the information already presented here. In exceptional circumstances, a student who does not meet the criteria for regular admission may be granted conditional admission. The Department will specify the conditions a student must meet to achieve regular status and will advise the student accordingly. The student must fulfill the conditions within two sessions of registration in the Graduate College, or face dismissal. Admission in this special category is reserved for cases where there are strong indications for success in the program, despite weaknesses in certain parts of the application. We organize a ""Visit Day"" for prospective graduate students in November. You'll be able to interact with our graduate students and faculty and hear more about our research, courses, internship/job opportunities, funding opportunities, etc. Write to our Graduate Program Administrator atcs-info@list.uiowa.eduif you'd like to visit.

University of Connecticut,"Program Requirements|Plan A|Plan B|Admission Requirements|Time for Completion Successful M.S. applicants typically possess a B.A. or B.S. in Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, or Computer Engineering. Specifically, the M.S. program in Computer Science and Engineering maintains the following minimum requirements for admission: Students missing a small portion of these courses may be admitted under the condition that they complete the requirements during their degree. As the M.S. program does permit 6 credits of upper-division CSE undergraduate courses to be counted towards the degree, in some cases completion of the requirements above can also serve to meet M.S. degree requirements. Application deadline: For full consideration, applications must be received by January 1. For further details, including limits on course and credit transfer, see theThe Graduate School, Admissions. Students wishing to pursue a Master of Science (M.S.) degree must associate themselves with a faculty advisor in consultation with whom they will select anadvisory committee. The advisory committee consists of three faculty members chaired by the advisor. The advisory committee is responsible for reviewing the student’splan of study(see below) and–for Plan A students–evaluating thesis work. The Master’s programs are designed to be flexible. Course selection, in either program, is the responsibility of the student in consultation with the student’s advisory committee. Student’s compile aPlan of Studyindicating the coursework they intend to use to fulfill the degree. Advanced undergraduate computing courses (with prescribed limits, see below) may be included in the Plan of Study. Additionally, graduate courses taken outside of CSE are also permitted (with prescribed limits, see below). The Plan of Study must be approved by the student’s advisory committee in order to satisfy the degree requirements. The current plan of study form, with a detailed description of course requirements, can be found with the otherforms. The Plan A program allows a student to combine individual study with general course work. The requirements for this degree are: For further details, see theM.S. Program Description in the Graduate Catalogand the CSE MSPlan of Study form. The master’s thesis is an essential element of the Plan A program. Master’s theses can be roughly classified into two categories: research theses and design theses. A research thesis reports on original research undertaken by the student on a problem in computer science and engineering. A research master’s thesis need not necessarily constitute a major original contribution to knowledge as is expected from a Ph.D. dissertation. It should, however, represent the solution to a meaningful problem from an appropriate area of computer science. A design thesis reports on a design, implementation (in software and/or hardware), verification, and documentation of a complete computing system. In either case, the thesis topic is identified in collaboration with the student’s adviser. The master’s thesis represents the equivalent of at least nine graduate credits. The thesis document itself must adhere to the Graduate School’s specifications; see theM.S. Program Description in the Graduate Catalog. Thesis proposal.Master’s students must develop a thesis plan in consultation with their adviser. When a thesis topic has been agreed upon, the student must submit athesis proposalto his or her advisory committee. The document should cover previous work in the area, define the specific problem to be addressed, and outline the research plan. Once this proposal is approved, formal work on the thesis can begin. Normally, it is expected that the thesis topic will be selected and approved as soon as possible, certainly before the end of the first complete year of study (i.e., by the beginning of the third semester of residence). Students are required to present their thesis proposal to their committee and other interested faculty so that the scope of the research project is clearly understood by all parties. The proposal will consist of an oral presentation based upon a document distributed to the committee in advance. For further details, see theM.S. Program Description in the Graduate Catalog. Oral defense of thesis.Near the end of the thesis work, the student will present a seminar on his or her results. For further details, see theM.S. Program Description in the Graduate Catalog. The Plan B master’s program is entirely based on coursework, perhaps including independent study courses. For further details, see theM.S. Program Description in the Graduate Catalogand the CSE M.S.Plan of Study form. Accepted students with a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related area typically complete the M.S. degree requirements in two or three semesters of full-time study. Students with a less comprehensive computing background may require additional time. Teaching assistants and research assistants typically require more time to complete the program, as they must allocate effort to these non-course-related activities. Under normal conditions, on-campus students–even those holding teaching or research assistantships–complete the M.S. degree requirements in four semesters or less.
