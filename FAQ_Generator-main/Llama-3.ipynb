Admission Text: Michigan State University's College of Engineering offers a Master of Science (M.S.) and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE). The M.S. program provides options for thesis or non-thesis tracks, while the Ph.D. program emphasizes research preparation. Both programs require a minimum of 30 credits for the M.S. and 90 credits for the Ph.D., with specific course requirements outlined. Applicants must hold a bachelor's or master's degree from an accredited institution, with a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. International applicants must demonstrate English proficiency through standardized tests like TOEFL or IELTS. The application process involves submission of required materials, including transcripts, test scores, letters of recommendation, and a statement of purpose. Applicants without a computer science background may need to complete prerequisite courses before starting the program. Admission decisions are based on various factors, including academic qualifications, research interests, and potential for success in the program. Financial support options, such as fellowships and teaching or research assistantships, are available for eligible applicants. For further inquiries or assistance with the application process, prospective students can contact the College of Engineering's Office of Graduate Admissions.\\n\\n### Input:\\nThe Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia offers a comprehensive overview of its graduate programs, including eligibility requirements, application procedures, and funding opportunities. The department provides detailed information on its Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs, outlining the differences between the two options. Applicants are required to hold a four-year bachelor's degree, with preference given to those with a background in computer science or a related field. The department emphasizes the importance of submitting all required application materials, including three letters of recommendation and a resume or curriculum vitae. Additionally, applicants must demonstrate proficiency in English, with specific requirements outlined for non-native English speakers. The department notes that admission decisions are made on a rolling basis, and applicants are encouraged to apply early to ensure consideration for available funding opportunities. Contact information for further inquiries is provided, highlighting the department's commitment to supporting prospective students throughout the application process.\\n\\n### Response:\\nWhat are the eligibility requirements for graduate study at UVA?
