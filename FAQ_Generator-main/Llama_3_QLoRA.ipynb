Generate the possible admission related FAQ\\'s from this admission text\"\\n\\n### Input:\\nProspective applicants to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley are invited to explore one of the leading research and instructional programs in the world. The department offers Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programs, emphasizing research preparation and experience. Notably, UC Berkeley no longer requires or accepts GRE scores for admissions. The next application cycle will be for Fall 2025, with the application reopening in September 2024. Applicants can choose between the EE and CS divisions, with various specialization areas available under each division. The department does not offer online degree programs or part-time options, and there is no rolling admission process. Spring semester admission is not available. Additionally, applicants may only apply to one department or degree program. While a background in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science is preferred, applicants from other disciplines are welcome to apply. The EECS Department provides guidance through programs like the Equal Access Assistance (EAAA) program, offering feedback on application materials. However, participation in EAAA does not guarantee admission. For more information, applicants are encouraged to review the department\\'s Frequently Asked Questions and learn about graduate fellowship opportunities through the Campaign for Berkeley.\\n\\n### Response:'"
