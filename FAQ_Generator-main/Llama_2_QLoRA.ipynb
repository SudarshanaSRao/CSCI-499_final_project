Generate the possible admission related FAQ\\'s from this admission text\"\\n\\n### Input:\\nThe Computer Science Department at UA Little Rock offers a Master of Science in Computer Science, a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Sciences with an emphasis in Computer Science, and a graduate certificate in cybersecurity. The Master of Science program emphasizes current trends in computing, providing a strong theoretical and practical foundation for careers or further graduate studies. The curriculum comprises a core curriculum covering traditional computer science areas and specialization coursework allowing students to delve deeper into specific areas of interest. Applicants for the Fall semester should submit completed applications by June 15, with decisions notified from March 15 onwards, while for the Spring semester, applications should be completed by November 15, with decisions notified from October 15 onwards. The department advises against applying for the summer term due to limited graduate class offerings. International students are encouraged to seek information from the Office of International Student Services regarding immigration regulations. The Computer and Information Sciences Doctoral Program, housed in the Donaghey College of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, aims to foster multidisciplinary collaborations across computing disciplines. The program offers emphasis areas and requires completion of a graduate certificate in cybersecurity, which consists of 15 credits and can be completed alongside other graduate programs within the department.\\n\\n### Response:'"
